# ðŸš€ Leetcode-Patterns

This repository contains solutions and templates for common **LeetCode problem-solving patterns**.  
The goal is to provide a structured way to master popular DSA techniques that repeatedly appear in coding interviews.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **FastAndSlowPointers/**
  - Problems involving the fast & slow pointer (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection, Palindrome Linked List, etc.)

- **PrefixSum/**
  - Problems solved using prefix sum techniques  
  - Example: Maximum Subarray Sum of Size K

- **SlidingWindow/**
  - Problems applying the sliding window approach  
  - Example: Minimum Window Substring

- **TwoPointers/**
  - Classic two-pointer problems (sorted array, linked list, string manipulation, etc.)

- **out/production/Patterns/**
  - Compiled / output files

---

## ðŸ“Œ Patterns Covered
- âœ… Two Pointers  
- âœ… Fast & Slow Pointers  
- âœ… Prefix Sum  
- âœ… Sliding Window  

More patterns will be added over time to cover:  
- Binary Search  
- Monotonic Stack  
- Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming

## ðŸ’¡ Why Patterns?
Most coding interview questions follow **recurring patterns**.  
Instead of solving problems randomly, learning these patterns helps to:
1. Recognize problem types quickly  
2. Apply the right strategy  
3. Save time in interviews
